HOW TO RUN THIS CODE:

The main script is 'Project_menu.m':
if you run it, a menu will appear that allows you to choose the result of any question (from 2 to 7).
The model (question 1) is inside the report.

For questions "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"  you can also choose to look at the saved result (stored in the folder 
"Saved_data") or to start a new simulation, setting the parameters inside the script.
